I've had a couple of lean weeks in work, brought on by the fact that my last project was canned (**a seriously not nice feeling when you've worked on something for the guts of 9 months**) and there were some __issues__, which I won't go into, preventing me moving on to a new project. But every cloud has a silver lining and the down time has actually given me a chance to play with a few libraries that I had only read about up until this point.
